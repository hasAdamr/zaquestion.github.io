<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Since very young I have been interested in software and game development. I
have several years of personal experience in development using the C# and XNA
platform. I am also capable in Forms and Console development. I have worked
with C/C++ for about a year and can program effectively with the standard
library as well as DirectX 9 and 11. I am interested in testing as I have a
firm grasp of what goes into development and a significant amount of personal
experience testing software for bugs. </p>

<h1>Experience</h1>

<p><strong>Nintendo of America Inc.</strong><b><br>
<strong>Aerotek</strong><br>
<strong>Dec. 2012 - Current </strong></b></p>

<p>At Nintendo of America Inc. I worked as a hardware/compatibility tester. I
was responsible for running multiple batteries of tests using Cygwin. In
addition I wrote new test cases in between starting automated tests. Where
possible I used my programming experience to automate tests and distributed the
automations to my team. I took every opportunity to improve that I could,
including reading the in-house SDK and starting on a second battery of tests.
On the team I played the role of a “natural lead” while I had no such title
other members of the team frequently came to me for information on how to run
the tests, how to setup/fix the systems, and all other questions. In my solo
role I ran tests and communicated directly with developers to solve problems. </p>

<p><strong>Midian LARP</strong><b><br>
<strong>May 2012 - July 2012 </strong></b></p>

<p>I was hired by a local fantasy game startup to write software to make it
easier for players to design characters for the game “Midian LARP.” I was
responsible for writing the entire program from the ground up using Windows
Forms in C#. Midian LARP made use of multiple types of skill building systems
that had to be specially programed to account for a large number of single use
special cases the game used. Special cases in the application made it bug
prone. I tested the application extensively using notepad to enter in bug
reports. </p>

<p><strong>Whisper Game Studios</strong><b><br>
<strong>March 2011 – May 2011 </strong></b></p>

<p>I worked as lead developer for the sound component of the Whisper Engine for
use with the game Elysia. The project was entirely in C# with XNA, I was
responsible for writing the sound engine from scratch. I worked with the sound
director (Christi O’Donnell) closely so that her vision could be perfectly
emulated in the engine. <br>

<p><strong>DirectX 9 Wrapper</strong><b><br>
<strong>December 2011 – March 2012 </strong></b></p>

<p>I wrote a fully functioning set of classes to ease the use of DirectX 9 in
C++. I based the wrapper off of concepts from XNA 3.1 and XNA 4.0. The wrapper
is capable of creating full 3D graphics with significantly less work than using
Native DirectX. </p>

<p><strong>Psychedelic Flying-Disc Hospital</strong><b><br>
<strong>August 2012 – August 2012 <o:p></o:p></strong></b></p>

<p>As a contestant in StudentRND's Codeday (www.codeday.org) I designed and
wrote a game in 24 hours using XNA 4.0. All the code including physics, and
shaders was written in about 15 hours. The game took 1st place and is available
for download <a href="www.zaqthefreshman.com/PsychedelicFlyingDisc/">here.</a> </p>
